# Encrypted-Chat-App

It is a two way chat app.It uses firebase to store user data and messages.  
-It even accepts image of user so you can recognize your friends easily.  
-It gives the user two options to encrypt the data,either AES or DES  
-It shows the time of sent and received messages   
-The message is first encrypted in device and then sent.It is only decrypted when it reaches the other device.  
-The message is stored in server in encrypted form so that no one can read your message in between for example  
1)Your ISP cannot read your messages   
2)If you are using public wifi then no one can read your messages.  

For security reasons I have not included my google-services.json file .You can get your own google-services.json file from firebase and put it in "app" folder then you can build and use the app without any hassle.
